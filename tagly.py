'''
Tags are lowercase ASCII letters and digits with potentially ambiguous
characters and vowels removed.  This leaves these twenty-four characters:

    2 3 4 7 9 c d f g h j k m n p q r s t v w x y z

First we find the MD5 sum of the URL, take the integer that that
represents as a hexidecimal number, and then encode that in base-24 with
the above symbols, in reverse order, as numerals.
