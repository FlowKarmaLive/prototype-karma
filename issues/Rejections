Rejections
==============

change send to site owner to just list publicly.  We can have a hall of
shame where you enter and URL to see a list of all its public rejections.

We should also permit registered URL-havers to see the rejections for
their URLs; and a way for users to see rejections sent by their contacts.

If each rejection has its own URL then they can be propagated using the
system itself, to enable "back-flow" of rejection information (feedback).
