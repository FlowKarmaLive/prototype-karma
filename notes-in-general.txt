So it sucks that there are three languages involved (actually more): Elm,
Python, SQL.  Under the hood there's Javascript, of course, and also
whatever the above things are themselves written in: C for Sqlite and
Python, dunno about Elm, nor the browsers.  Caddy is written in Go.

And so it goes.  It's a wonder any of this stuff works at all.

The languages themselves are wonky: Elm is pretty solid but Python is a
hyperactive cat, and SQL, despite being venerable, has its own host of
issues and gotchas.  Sqlite is a pretty solid and simple (for a DB)
program but it's got a large manual, eh?

Python is just starting to get sane.  Still I managed to pass the
profile() function to the DB when I meant to pass the prof variable that
names a string value (not a function).  The error message was obscure but
the real WTF is that the language let me do it in the first place.
That's Python for you:  it's a scripting language, not for serious work.

There's another whole problem with the model and API not being
first-class artifacts of the system.  Again, Elm is pretty good here,
making the model a 1st-class entity, but the APIs are still specified in
ad hoc code rather than a single "source of truth".  I looked at
Swagger/OpenAPI but that's another whole pile of stuff to learn and work
on, that's not stable.  (They changed the CLI for accessing help from v1
to v2, because, yeah, /that's/ the problem.)  Too much churn.  There are
other API-as-1st-class tools/systems out there.  It's weird that this is
still a thing in 2020.  (So many things should be done by now that
aren't: chat apps, etc.)



If you look at what the server code is actually doing it's not that
complex.  The length of the code seems linear with the work it's doing
with no clear refactoring (there are a few bits, sure, but no big wins)
so that indicates that we are close to the problem domain.  (In other
words, the constructs available in e.g. Python are very close to the
constructs needed for a theoretically optimal description of the domain.)

It's not worth writing another DSL for declarative web app definition?
 


Html as function with two list args is a little weird.  It's not a
datastructure, it's a function call.

For one thing the idea that a DIV is a list of HTML is not reflected in
the Elm, e.g. to add a legend to a fieldset in Elm you prepend it to the
second list arg of the div function, as contrasted with, perhaps,
appending an HTML "object" to a DIV "object" (that has list-like api
methods that automatically dispatch on the type of the args: attrs affect
attrs, html affects the div children elements), eh?

In practice it seems to work well enough.  In principle, it seems to me
to be another example of the real issue being addressed obliquely through
what the language affords, rather being tackled head-on (as Elm does in
general for the domain of web app frontend development.) (The first
example being the ad hoc nature of the HTTP API.)

Recall that Elm started as a way to address "Functional Reactive
Programming" first, with web development as one possible area of
application.  So perhaps it's not surprising that the language is not
more tightly wedded to the domain (even as the runtime is.)

I'm not trying to critcize Elm, it's lightyears ahead of the competition,
I'm just recording some thoughts and impressions.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


The DB could compute the timestamp but it's a hash (metaphorically, not literally):


select CAST(strftime('%s', 'now') as INTEGER) + CAST(substr(strftime('%f', 'now'), 3) as NUMERIC);

SELECT      (CAST(strftime('%s', 'now') as INTEGER) + CAST(substr(strftime('%f','now'), 3) as NUMERIC)) * 1000;
SELECT CAST((CAST(strftime('%s', 'now') as INTEGER) + CAST(substr(strftime('%f','now'), 3) as NUMERIC)) * 1000 as INTEGER);


Oy vey!  What a schmolé:

Get the seconds as a string and cast to int
Get the ss.mmm as a string, remove 'ss.', convert to float
Add seconds and milliseconds together
Multiply by 1000 to shift the decimal right three places
Cast the whole number of milliseconds to int.


CAST(
    (
        CAST(
            strftime('%s', 'now') as INTEGER
        )
        + 
        CAST(
            substr(strftime('%f','now'), 3) as NUMERIC)
    )
    * 
    1000
    as INTEGER
    )

It's tempting to just have the time field be filled by e.g.:

    strftime('%s %f', 'now')

and just let it be kinda broken...  Leaving it as a string,

or converting to float with the space omitted:

    CAST(strftime('%s%f', 'now') as NUMERIC)


Or just keep doing it in the Python:

    def T():
        return int(round(time(), 3) * 1000)

Simpler, but is it more efficient?  I think it would have to be, without
all the type casting, on the other hand, if Sqlite is closer to the metal
than Python...?   But that doesn't seem likely.  These are just C lib
calls afterall.
